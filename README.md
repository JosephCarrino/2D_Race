------------2D RACE-------------

+ A simple C++ car game made in ASCII-Art. 
  The game is score-based and implements a gradual difficulty. It also has a fuel mechanic.
  
+ You can lose score and fuel by hitting obstacoles who run towards you, or you can increase
  your score and your fuel by taking gas. The more score you get, the higher level you reach.
  
+ It is possible to choose three different difficulties: easy, normal and hard. The difficulty
  will affect the damages and the number of enemies on-screen.
  
+ In the folder "Allegati" you can find a more detailed relation and readme, both written
  in italian.
